## Purpose of the project

We made this code after seeing popular twitch streamers being recreated with AI and wanted to do something similar but with our friends. Thus we decided to try and see if we could replicate the speech patterns of the friend group using current available resources like ChatGPT. Instead of training our own model with hundreds of thousands, and sometimes even millions of datapoints, we decided to use agent models.

## Agent Model?

Essentially instead of training a model ourselves, we realized we can prompt chatGPT to "be" and talk like someone. Using relevant information like personality, facts, and example messages from that person, we are getting closer and closer to sounding just like that person.
