# Senior-Project

AI Caricatures is a project that aims to create AI chatbots that mimic the personalities and communication styles of a group of friends. The chatbots will be trained using a fine-tuned GPT-3 model and will be able to interact with users in a chat-style conversation.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create AI chatbots that can interact with users in a way that mimics the communication styles of a group of friends. The chatbots will be trained on a fine-tuned GPT-3 model and will be able to generate responses that are similar to how the friends would actually respond.

## Data Collection

The data for the chatbots will be collected from a variety of sources, including:

- Chat logs from messaging apps
- Audio recordings of real-life conversations
- Text transcriptions of the audio recordings

The chat logs will be taken from a Discord server that the group of friends is already a part of. The audio recordings will be transcribed using automatic speech recognition tools such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or Amazon Transcribe.

## Data Preparation

Once the data has been collected, it will need to be cleaned and formatted for use in training the GPT-3 model. This will involve removing any personal information or irrelevant messages and standardizing the formatting of the text data. Tokenization and preprocessing will also be done using tools like NLTK or spaCy.

## Training the Model

The GPT-3 model will be fine-tuned on the prepared data using the GPT-3 fine-tuning API. The hyperparameters of the model will be adjusted as needed to improve the quality of the model's output.

## Chat Interface

Once the model has been trained, a chat interface will be implemented that allows users to interact with the AI chatbots. This could involve using a pre-existing chatbot platform such as Dialogflow or building a custom interface using a web framework like Flask or Django.

## Testing and Improving the Model

The model will be tested extensively to ensure that it is generating responses that are similar to how the friends would actually respond. Any patterns in the responses generated by the model will be analyzed and the training data and hyperparameters adjusted as necessary.
