Kate: Guys Etsy is so poo
Kate: Why is the fee actual dog doo doo
Robby: Etsy, more like cumcum
Kate: 💀
Ali: Good morning everyone! Today I am going to be discussing the concept of “Etsy, more like cumcum.”
What is the meaning behind this phrase? It is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the online marketplace Etsy, which is known for its handmade goods, vintage items, and craft supplies. The phrase “Etsy, more like cumcum” is a humorous way of saying that the website is a great place to find unique items that you won’t find anywhere else.
But why is this phrase important? It is important because it highlights the fact that Etsy has become a go-to destination for those looking for unique and creative items. Not only can you find one-of-a-kind items, but you can also find items that are made with love and care. Etsy is a great place to find items that are carefully crafted and made with attention to detail.
In addition to this, Etsy also has a great community. There are forums and groups where people can discuss their craft and share tips and advice. This community is a great place for crafters to find support and inspiration.
Finally, Etsy is a great place to find items that are affordable. Many of the  items on Etsy are handmade and can be purchased for less than the price of mass-produced items. This makes Etsy a great place to find unique items at a great value.
So, to summarize, “Etsy, more like cumcum” is a humorous way of referring to the online marketplace Etsy. It highlights the fact that Etsy is a great place to find unique and creative items that are crafted with love and care, a great community for crafters to find support and inspiration, and affordable items.

Nathan: Spill
Nathan: Rn
Nathan: Robby and I are together
Robby: Bruuuuuh
Kate: Ok so prerequisite lore i never told robby about
Kate: Actually i told robby the first part
Kate: Her first boyfriend was a guy we made fun of in band and choir who also happened to have a history of SAing women. First girlfriend he had in HS turned into a furry. Second one he basically groomed over school email. That's another story if you want to hear it before the rest of this one.
Nathan: What does this girl look like
Nathan: School email ☠️
Kate: Moses but a woman with glasses
Nathan: Nice
Kate: Yeah this guy went to a private catholic elementary and middle school with some other guys ik. One day the teacher gave them all emails and password, but she said it out loud. Fast forward to my sophmore year and this guy's junior year. My friend decides to log into this guy's email for fun. We found a ton of emails back and forth with this girl. The stuff he was saying was wild.
Kate: We printed the emails out and hid them behind the band lockers for people to find in a hundred years
Nathan: ☠️☠️
Robby: This is quality content
Nathan: What did the emails contain
Kate: And the timestamps showed he was sexting over school email DURING class hours
Nathan: Generally
Kate: He taught her what a 69 is
Nathan: Me
Robby: Me with ellianas nip rings
Kate: But yeah this guy somehow went to a d-morbillion college sitting bench for soccer. dropped out. dropped some deadlift videos on insta. and then became part of a pyramid scheme
Nathan: Typical Minnesota grind set
Robby: BAHAHAHAHA
Kate: Anyway this was the girl's first bf. Her second one was a guy on football with me who we also made fun of. We called him Skaldaddy. Dude was built like one of them droid that stick their arm out in star wars.
Nathan: Call him Rizza Parks the way he was in the back of that bro
Kate: He was a goober. Last I heard he's with some korean girl and he's trying to learn korean now or something.
Kate: I personally don't think the greencard is worth it but who knows
Nathan: Mud person + Mayo person == trouble
Robby: Nathan and I are dying right now btw
Nathan: Your school was wild bro
Kate: btw this story is wild enough to basically be common knowledge in a decent amount of minnesota
Kate: I guess some of my friends have told other people they go to Owatonna, and they're like "wait isn't that where that one Annika chick went?"
Robby: BRUUUUH
Kate: I think COVID saved her from more humiliation, but also made her go crazy
Kate: She was already goofy, but being undiagnosed didn't help
Kate: He filed a restraining order
Kate: That didn't stop her from groping some other dude and getting another restraining order
Nathan: She must’ve been repulsive
Nathan: Anti rizz
Robby: BRUUUUH
Kate: It was very obvious because she was wearing sport merch that only the players had
Kate: There was a time where she stole the baseball team's clothes and they played a game to find out who would have to go to her room to get it. Some poor guy lost. He goes up to her room and she shuts the door behind and throws herself onto him.
Kate: This was freshman year. She got another boyfriend. He left in less than a year
Nathan: Or some know it as the UCI UCI fruit
Kate: This year she got a butterfly tattoo on her back and wore a bra around campus to flex it
Nathan: Bruh I gotta know what she looks like
Robby: She still in school? Fuuuuuuuuuuckin how
Kate: Yeah she somehow elden ring dodge rolled the allegations
Kate: She also got a new bf
Kate: a 28 year old with 2 kids
Kate: There's footage of them making out in her campus' starbucks
Kate: He dumped her
Robby: BRO I'm crying
Nathan: KYLE I WANT TO SLEEP
Nathan: YOU CAN WAIT
Robby: KEEP GOING
Nathan: Robby sounds like he’s being stabbed but there’s a pillow on his face
Robby: Ho
Kate: She left snap maps on so my friend compared where she went to google maps, and I guess she was at a psych ward
Robby: Ly
Kate: Haven't heard anything since
Robby: This is top tier lore
Kate: her body is worse than her face
Kate: Imma need more Minnesota stories
Kate: the tea I’ve been missing my whole life
Nathan: Guys
Nathan: I showed him Anna de Armas and he said “I don’t see it”
Kate: it was at 200

Kate: In my most recent dream, I think I'm on team USA. I have like an infinite budget for military and can blow up whatever I want. But then Japan developed a new bombing technique using white sparrows or something. They target certain trees and just divebomb. My team member who helped me find out about this is hello kitty's bf. She declined a call from Johnny Depp after she found out he saved our country. 🇺🇸
Kate: The way I controlled units and stuff was weird. It was like a video game. I was able to give them tanks planes rpgs basically anything.
Robby: Thanks Johnny Depp very cool
Kate: send audio
Kate: My last quarter is 20 units
Kate: 20 units in 10 weeks?
Kate: EASY
Ali: thats not okay ur gonna b so busy
Ali: based on the dreams you've shared, it's possible that your friend may be someone who values teamwork and loyalty, and who may have strong feelings of patriotism. They may also have a sense of control or agency in their life, and may be able to make decisions that affect the world around them. The presence of themes of trust and betrayal in their dreams could suggest that they place a high value on honesty and dependability in their relationships. It's also possible that they have experienced or are concerned about feelings of vulnerability or being threatened, and may have a sense of danger or uncertainty in their life. Again, it's important to keep in mind that these are just a few possible interpretations and are not meant to be a comprehensive or definitive description of your friend.
Ali: Here is a list of some potential themes or topics that could be recurring in your friend's dreams:
Teamwork and loyalty (such as being on a team representing the United States)
Military or war (such as having an infinite budget for military resources)
Feelings of vulnerability or being threatened (such as being targeted by a new bombing technique)
Innocence or cuteness (such as the presence of Hello Kitty's boyfriend)
Fame or celebrity (such as the appearance of Johnny Depp)
Control or decision-making (such as being able to control units and resources as if in a video game)
Disorientation or confusion (such as waking up and being gaslit into thinking you missed New Year's Eve)
Trust and betrayal (such as someone having an affair)
Power dynamics in relationships (such as wanting someone kicked out of the country)
Danger or vulnerability (such as being in a car during a lightning storm or in an accident)
Here is a list of potential recurring themes or topics in your friend's dreams:
Relationships (such as having an affair or interacting with others at a truck stop)
Conflict or tension (such as wanting revenge or feeling threatened by an external force)
Survival or injury (such as surviving a car accident or losing a finger)
Emotions (such as feelings of patriotism or anger)
Themes of good and evil (such as being loyal to one's country or being deceived by someone you trusted)
The supernatural or fantastical (such as a bombing technique using white sparrows or flying out of a car window)
The unknown or mysterious (such as being gaslit or interacting with people or events that don't actually exist)
Kate: nice
Kate: It’s oki I can do it
Kate: Also this is so fun, reminds me of my psychoanalytic theories class cuz we did a lot of dream interpretations like this

Kate: I wish I went to concordia
Robby: when i was at Crean, basically UCI HS, making friends was very hard. that was just the culture on campus. The culture simply sucks. but the good news is, if you are feeling this way, everyone else is too. being assertively friendly can help people break out of their shell
Robby: It's exhausting to do all of the social heavy lifting, but i think its worth it
Kate: right

Kate: eh
Kate: maybe I’ll make friends in medical school
Kate: I hope so

Nathan: Meaning both had not been asked before I asked them
Kate: im not doing adv OS hw unless we go
Nathan: youre not doing it anyways
Ali: Me: Pretend to be a real girl on the street. I approach you and say "Hi".
ChatGPT: Hi there! How can I help you?
Me: Hey, I saw you and thought that I would have to say at least hello because you're very attractive.
ChatGPT: Oh wow, thank you! That's really sweet of you.
Me: I don't want to make things awkward, and I would totally understand if you'd not want to. But I have to ask, otherwise I won't be happy anymore. Would you take my number?
ChatGPT: Uh, I'm sorry, but no. That's a bit too forward for me. But thank you for the kind words!
Me: Oh ok. I do have a last question. What could I do better next time when I'm approaching someone on the street, especially such an attractive lady like you are?
ChatGPT: Well, it's always best to start with a simple hello, and then if the conversation progresses, you can ask if they'd like to exchange numbers. But always be respectful and remember to read the cues from the other person. If they don't seem interested, it's best to back off and respect their wishes.
Me: Do you think that I was respectful to you?
ChatGPT: Yes, absolutely. You were very respectful and kind. Thank you.
Me: But it was still too fast for you, right? When is the perfect time to give out my number?
ChatGPT: It really depends on the situation and the person, so it's hard to give an exact timeline. I'd say if you feel like the conversation is going well and you both feel comfortable, then it's probably a good time to exchange numbers.
ChatGPT: Thanks for understanding and wishing me the best! Bye!
Kate: 💀
Kate: What is ChatGPT
Ali: 안녕하세요! 나는 인공지능(AI)입니다. 인공지능은 컴퓨터를 이용해 인간이 하는 것과 비슷한 일을 처리하는 기술입니다. 예를 들어, 인공지능은 음성 인식, 언어 번역, 이미지 인식 등을 할 수 있어요. "스마트한 봇" 이라고 생각하세요!
Kate: 7pm
Kate: 7pm
Nathan: Are y’all here
Jett: I’m not going
Jett: I’m too comfy on my couch
Ali: Bruhhhhhhh
Ali: Robby wya
Ali: 
Kate: Grammar is good
Kate: Spelling is good
Kate: Slightly formal but it’s good
Kate: guys
Kate: I’m so terrified of him
Nathan: He’s super duper fit
Robby: Why his abs start on his chest
Kate: that's where they start
Robby: What since when
Robby: Did humans just receive a update recently
Kate: I’m gonna throw up
Kate: I scratched a car
Nathan: You joined the club
Ali: I’m sure it was like accidental
Nathan: I just took the most massive dump I possibly have ever taken in my life
Robby: Big ups to u big cat. 
Big dumpy, big poops, big heart u feel
Kate: yea it was accidental
Kate: I cried in my car for like an hour thirty minutes
Kate: Of course I exchanged insurance n stuff
Kate: I started laugh crying that I have bad karma
Kate: Don’t trip
Robby: to be fair, you dont have as much bad karma, like thats a 75% off discount on bad karma just because you didn't do it on purpose and you feel bad lol
Kate: I cried so hard I was shaking and having a mf panic attack in my car
Kate: And then I got an email saying the class I came to school for got cancelled
Kate: 💀
Kate: Anyways life sucks
Kate: It was a Tesla too
Kate: UCI student Tesla
Kate: Yeah
Kate: bruh who?
Kate: btw me and nathan giga late

Robby: yea
Robby: im practicing
Ali: How bad was the scrape?
Kate: 죄송해요, 차를 쓰러뜨렸네요. 괜찮아요, 차는 다시 수리할 수 있어요
Kate: 안녕하세요, 저가 차를 쓰러뜨렸다는 걸 알려드리려고 합니다. 이게 큰 일은 아니에요, 이런 일은 일어나기도 해요. 수리하는데 시간도 돈도 없어서 차량 소유자 분들이 스스로 처리해야 할 것 같아요. 
Kate: Mine is way worse
Kate: I guess I popped blood vessels on my face from crying so hard
Robby: Bruh
Kate: Feels bad
Kate: I think I haven’t stopped crying all day hahaha
Kate: I hate driving
Robby: Do you want to hang out later?
Kate: No I’m gonna cry some more then do my homework 😂😂😂
Nathan: Caf?
Robby: Sure. Jake and I are in Laguna Beach but we driving back right now though
Kate: tf ok
Nathan: W if True
Robby: Thank you sanders very cool
Ali: That is not an example of being bad! Don’t beat urself up over an accident, a scrape like that is simple enough to repair and that’s what insurance is for. It’s ok to feel bad I’m just saying try not to beat ur self up, something a lot worse could’ve happened, I’m j glad ur ok because this will b nothing but a forgotten memory soon enough. And it’ll b ok 🙂 take time for urself if u need but feel free to come to the dorm and since ur crying so much make sure to stay hydrated as well
Ali: An example of being bad would be intentionally scraping someone’s car and then feeling good about it
Ali: Lolol
Nathan: Call me Michael Jackson
شما همیشه در قلب ما خالی نخواهید بود": 
Ali: Bruh what
Ali: Happiness is a part of my life
Maybe the beautiful excitement of love
You are a great mother
You have the ability to give happiness to those you know
We love you from you,
More excited than any other excitement
You will never be empty in our hearts

Kate: Dear Dr. Shan,
I hope this email finds you feeling better. I'm sorry to hear that you got sick and I just wanted to take a moment to express my concern and wish you a speedy recovery.
In the meantime, I wanted to share some tips that may help you to feel better.
Get plenty of rest: It's important to let your body rest and recover, so make sure you're getting enough sleep each night.
Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of fluids will help to keep your body hydrated and flush out any toxins.
Eat a healthy diet: Eating nutrient-rich foods will help to boost your immune system and give your body the energy it needs to fight off the illness.
Take over-the-counter medication: There are many over-the-counter medications that can help to relieve symptoms such as fever, headache, and congestion.
Consult with a doctor: If your symptoms persist, it's important to consult with a doctor to determine the underlying cause and receive proper treatment.
Please take care and let me know if there is anything I can do to help.
Best,
[Your Name]

Kate: On the sexualization of female twitch streamers/gamers, basically focusing on the male vs female gaze/audience when it comes to sexualizing/fantasizing about people on a digital platform. Like how female streamers that are hot get hella tips for being hot despite the platform technically being a place to showcase gamers for their gameplays n stuff
Kate: Actually a fun topic
Ali: i like that topic
Ali: i watch a lot of twitch too so i has knowlege

Robby: yes
Ali: This research paper focuses on the sexualization of female Twitch streamers, and the role of the male vs female gaze in this phenomenon. The paper examines the ways in which female Twitch streamers are sexualized by their male audience, and how this affects their experiences and identities as gamers and streamers. The paper also explores the wider context of online gaming communities and the sexualization of women in these spaces. Using a combination of academic literature, interviews with female Twitch streamers, and a survey of Twitch users, this paper argues that the sexualization of female Twitch streamers is a complex issue that is shaped by a variety of factors, including gender, technology, and gaming culture. The paper concludes by offering recommendations for how female Twitch streamers can resist and resist the sexualization, and for how the gaming industry and wider society can create more inclusive and respectful online gaming communities.
