 Yeah, so like everyone was asleep, talking to myself, kind of cathartic, emotional rollercoaster, best of times, worst of times, and then returned to normalcy once everyone else woke up. So here we are now. I don't know. I don't know about juice though. What kind of juice? Scratching his neck. And so if we can't, so I'm talking, I'm currently in communications with the friend who said we could stay there. Communications went cold with him. So if that happens, worst times are worst, parents said I could use the card for hotel room. Maybe maybe that maybe that's the best idea at this point. It's either that or stay at my other buddy's place who I actually do have communications with but it's an apartment and a small one at that. So we can just keep driving up to San Jose. I'm awake now. I can drive now. Oh my god. Yeah, that's.
