 We made it to the hotel. Walked around this San Luis Obispo downtown area. Pretty cool place. It was raining the entire time so kind of tough to see stuff. Stopped at a few stores. Of course Jake points out a baddie. Or what he likes to call a baddie I guess. It's kind of just a white thing with two legs. She was actually bad though. He's talking about the candy store. Yeah. Okay. Candy store was valid. Okay. Anywhere else probably not.
