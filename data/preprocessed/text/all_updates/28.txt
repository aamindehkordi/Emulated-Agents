 We're in Cowgirl Cafe. Me and Ollie were the last ones to wake up. We were kind of sitting in bed for a while. Then everyone started leaving so we realized we should probably get up and start moving along. I got chili. A little overpriced. It was like $6 chili. Still pretty good. And I'm eating Jake's pancakes because they actually gave him a shit ton. We had fun last night. Hopefully Robbie drives good. I don't know. He had quite a bit to drink.
