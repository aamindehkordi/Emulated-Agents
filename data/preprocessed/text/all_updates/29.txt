 We're just now leaving the cowgirl cafe. I had a non-spicy budget breakfast. So toast, eggs, and sausages for fucking $10. Jake ended up paying $20 for pancakes. Kyle got, I don't even know. Nathan got chili. Bobby's out here looking at his bingo sheet. You know I gotta get in here. I did throw up last night though, I think. I don't know. We'll see.
