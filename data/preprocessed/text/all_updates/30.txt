 Alright, so we're about to head off to Morro Bay. The sky is getting significantly clearer, or at least it's significantly clearer than it was yesterday. Everything's still very wet. It's also, I mean, it's still cloudy. It's really pretty. Mountains have snow on them. So where's the pencil at? It's actually cold near us, but things are looking up.
