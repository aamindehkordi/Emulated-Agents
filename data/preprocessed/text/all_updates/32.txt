 I'm pretty close to a day though. Hello. Update for today. After a tough night of sleep. We're back baby. Kyle is convincing me more and more everyday that, you know, he should be on love on the spectrum. And they're officially gaff-lighting me into liking Hailey Moses. Which I'm not fully opposed to but also, you know. So, trip pretty good so far. Also, update, Kyle is not going to be having his phone anymore.
