 Just went to the pier. Um, I feel excited. But we're going to like this hell hole place. Robbie didn't tell me about it but it looks kind of scary so I'm probably not going to go. Like I'll go but I'm not going to go in the hole. Um, but yeah. We're in there now and then we're going to see where we go from there I guess. I'm mostly chilling right now. Uh, yeah. See where the day takes us.
