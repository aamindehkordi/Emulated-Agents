 Just got back from the hellhole in little nowhere. You see Santa Cruz. Robbie is stressing us out. I thought for sure we'd be like caught in a mud slide on the way there. Uh, we got to watch Robbie go down the hellhole. Obviously, none of us want to go down there because we're not bozos. But, it's probably worth going and seeing to my future self. I think we should do autism tests. I'll probably be happy that I did it. On the way back up, Robbie also decided to climb down some very sketchy rocks. Or what he thought were rocks, but then stepped on them and realized they were leaves. Almost slid down. Controlled slide is what he called it. I don't know about that. Now we're headed to downtown.
