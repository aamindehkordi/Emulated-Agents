 We're driving on the road. We're playing this stupid guessing game. Robbie decides to come with A O A O domain. I finally solve it. And then I ask Robbie how the fuck are we supposed to get to our destination when the range is 13 miles and it's 12 miles away with red traffic in between. And he tells me, it's okay we'll make it. We have reserve gas. Yeah, well he changed his mind the moment it hit 11 and 11. He took a U-turn. The gas was going down really fast. Somehow we made it. It was like 3 miles away. We ended up getting there with probably 1.5 or 2 gas. 2 miles of gas left. Now we're filled up all the way up to 226 miles. Back on the road that we had a U-turn on. Now we're going back through this red traffic. Should take about an hour before we get out of it.
