 Oh my god it's dark. Just got some gas. I'm sure Kyle just filled you in on the details but we are doing well. Kind of just sitting through this traffic now. Be there in like an hour. Yeah my stress levels have been tested throughout this trip let's just say that. But you know that's the adventure of it so we're going to keep going on adventures and hopefully it'll be okay. You know what no it will be okay. Believe in us. Gas.
