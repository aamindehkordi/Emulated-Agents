 So I wake up, Robbie's at the bottom of a hill spinning out. Everyone's yelling at him that he doesn't have enough gas. And apparently in my time sleeping, he has been the biggest goomba of the month. Because he basically turned a 30 minute drive into a 2 hour drive. Which is what we're doing now. Now, you know shit happens, to be fair. I feel like this was avoidable. It was not avoidable. But now we know for the next time. It was avoidable, you get gas before you get on the road, Bozo. Now we know next time. Now we know next time that all we gotta do is just rent a car and not let Robbie drive the whole time. You can't rent a car Bozo, you're not 25. Well not yet, I'm only 2 years away. Idiot.
