 Alright, so, um, Google Maps has failed me once again. You're literally about to blame it on Google Maps. You were on E when you got on the road. Wait, what? No, I would have made it. He told Ali, he's like, Ali, by the way, when we get off of this road, we're gonna fill up. He's on E already. So, I found out, uh, I found out a few things about Santa Cruz. The traffic getting out of Santa Cruz could get really, really bad. And, um, I also found out that just because it says we have 26 miles left doesn't actually mean you have 26 miles left. It does. Just not when you move in. Two miles per hour. But, it was completely unavoidable. I couldn't be avoided. I can't avoid the traffic. The traffic is bad regardless. It's better sitting through traffic when you have gas in the tank, yeah? Yeah. But today was a really fun day. I'm hoping to get absolutely blasted while playing Bang. And then maybe, uh, maybe eat pizza with Ali's uncle. His tails are gooping me so I'm gonna go spread throughout the land. All I have to say is, uh, Doze fruit badum.
