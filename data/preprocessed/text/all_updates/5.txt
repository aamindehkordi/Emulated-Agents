 I'm excited about the trip. We're gonna get kicked out of somewhere. I'm pretty sure. We're probably gonna have to drag Ali from the depths of hell. Yeah, I'm writing some over-unders right now, so I'll record those and we'll take some beds. One of the over-unders is over under 12.5 combined hours of sleep per day for Kyle and Jake. So we'll see how that works. But yeah, it'll be a good trip. Yeah, we'll figure it out. I'll check back in with you.
