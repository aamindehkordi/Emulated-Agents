 update again since I accidentally hit the turn off button on this goofy off phone you can see Alcatraz off in the distance you can see Golden Gate Bridge over there. Can you see that on the phone? I can see it at least. Yeah San Francisco is really cool except for all the homelessness and theft we're all paranoid about the car and also had to pay $48 just for the privilege of parking so San Francisco may be like 4 out of 10. 10 out of 10 beauty. 0 out of 10 everything else.
