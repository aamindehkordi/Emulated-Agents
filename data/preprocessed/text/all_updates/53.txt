 Update, I'm in San Fran, near the water. I'm so cold. I'm not built for this kind of weather. These guys are but I'm not so I got my coat. Almost fell down. About to eat right now, I'm actually really hungry. But actually it's like not super cold or it's not like unbearably cold. It's pretty nice weather. Yeah it's raining a bit, I don't know if you can tell. But yeah, kind of just chilling out here. It smells great, there's a lot of food. I don't want to eat a lot of food. Obviously we're not going to eat everything. But yeah, very cool. I'll update you guys in a bit.
