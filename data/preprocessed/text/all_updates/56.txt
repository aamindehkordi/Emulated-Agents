 I'm doing better. We just went over the Golden Gate Bridge. Apparently, it's not a diversion. And we're going to the campsite. I think it's a campsite. It's a secret location, but I think we know what it is. It's like a dead miners town, ghost town, whatever. Oh, this water that we got is not like filtered. And I'm eating some like Korean seaweed. And it's not like seaweed. And I'm definitely going to get a stomach ache from it. And I don't know how I'm going to poop at the campsite with no toilet paper. So, we'll see about that. Um, yeah. I think I want to play some Crusader Kings. I don't know.
