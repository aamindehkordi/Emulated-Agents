 Just left San Fran. That was actually a really nice experience. Chinatown was way nicer than I remember. Got some cool stuff for Kate and for myself too. Went to the clam chowder. The clam chowder was good. I want to try the coral bay one to compare. The weather was super nice actually. It rained for a little bit but then it dried off after. It was so nice. We saw the little curvy road. We drove on it actually. Then we just passed the Golden Gate Bridge which was sick. Now we're heading over to this secret location where we're going to camp. Robbie told us where we're going to go but we don't really know what it is. I guess I'll update you when we get there. Overall, great day.
