 Yo what's up, update. It was cold outside so I bought our dress jacket. It was pretty comfy. Thanks Jeff. Also we, I got to eat at this deep cut Chinese place called Clay Hot Pot. They have this Boston Fried Chicken. I highly recommend it. Other than that, I saw this dude on the street in a fuckin' uh, like a moving wheelchair. He's like blasting some fuckin' rap music. That's pretty dope.
