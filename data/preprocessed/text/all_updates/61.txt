 So I just crossed over Golden Gate Bridge. We're going to the campsite. They say it closes at 9 and we're gonna get there at 8 53 so you know 7 minutes early. I think we'll be fine. But if not we will find a way. And low key I really just wanted to piss on the streets of San Francisco. Just to say I did. I controlled myself and did not. Although seeing actual human feces on the street in San Fran was a cool experience. I'm glad to say that I got to see that. Right now I'm just listening to Mainskin so I'm in a good mood I guess. What could be better than this? I don't know. It's the most beautiful thing.
