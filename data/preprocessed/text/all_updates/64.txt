 Update, we just left the campsite. We went to the village, kind of an angel's camp. Walked around for a bit. Food was sick. It was raining and snowing though, so a lot of places were closed. But it was a good experience. Walked around for a bit. And now we're heading out. I'm not sure where we're going, but we're going somewhere. So, Robbie will probably tell you where we're going. But yeah, slept in tents, it was wet as fuck. But, you gotta do what you gotta do. So yeah, hope you guys post it.
