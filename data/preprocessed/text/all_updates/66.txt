 Yo what's up we on the update. We just got done in the P.O.1 Semini mining town. Last night was cold as fuck. It wasn't even the cold though. It's just cause I was wet. And my sleeping bag was wet. The tent was wet. I'm still wet. And I'm not gonna lie I ain't no bitch but I'm looking to stay at a hotel tonight. Peace.
