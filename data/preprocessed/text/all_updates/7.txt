 Alright, so day one, it's raining. We had a late start, cause Kyle couldn't find his glasses, still couldn't find his glasses, and now he doesn't have no glasses, and that's okay, because where we're going we don't need glasses. But the rain is, I think, a good omen, cause that means that the snow in Yosemite is gonna be beautiful, even though everywhere else is gonna be probably less beautiful. You do, Robbie, will tell us why or not this is Cope. Yeah, yeah, there's a very good chance that this is all Cope, but I'm optimistic, I'm super fucking excited, I love everybody, I love the rain, let's see how long that lasts. Predictions, I'm gonna be a little bit worried. Number one, Ollie's gonna piss me off to the point of giving everyone the silent treatment, and then I'm just gonna start sulking like a dejected four year old. And yeah, I think, I'm really concerned, the main thing I'm concerned about is getting broken into in San Francisco, because like, San Francisco. But besides that, it's gonna be an excellent time.
