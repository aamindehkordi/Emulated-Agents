 stopped at a Chevron middle of nowhere near a town called Colterville a lot of snow on the ground this area probably got about six inches or so can't really go up any higher without the risk of there being icy roads and in a two-wheel drive car with one set of chains I feel like it's not a good idea so I think we're gonna go down and from there we'll see where we're able to go the nice thing is that the snow has stopped in this area so maybe it is safer but grab gas we should have enough to get wherever we need to go
