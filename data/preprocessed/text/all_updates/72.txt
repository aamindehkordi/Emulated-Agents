 Do you see anything out there? Do you like, cause I fucking don't. And that's okay because all I need is the road and the road is what I have. We went from 70 miles to 270 so that's pretty good on range. Yeah so we hit Colterville and you know at the beginning of the horror movie where a group of young bucks are saying like oh they're going to a cabin in the woods and then some elderly person at the cafe says you don't want to go there. Well we ran into those people in Colterville and unlike the horror movies we actually listened to them so I guess that's plus one for us. It's kind of like it reminds me of No Escape Room where it's like oh you don't want to go there. Fucking shit movie. So yeah Merced here we come. Good name here. Okay.
