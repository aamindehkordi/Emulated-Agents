 update, just put some tire chains on, that was fun. I feel like a real man now. Trying to get to the hotel, kind of running into some obstacles just because of the snow that we weren't expecting and like obviously we weren't really planning on going to a hotel but I think the consensus is we all really want to just to cool down or I guess warm up, dry off and have like a decent night's sleep. So yeah, kind of just doing that. I'm chilling back here, trying to fall asleep but we keep stopping so like I just want to make sure that we're smoothing on the road until I fall asleep but I think we're good now so I think it's Nappington City time. See ya.
