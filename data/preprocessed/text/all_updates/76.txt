 Just had lunch at Giovanni's in Morro Bay. Very good. Thanks for the recommendation, Kate. I'm heading to slow right now. Gonna bar hop maybe? Not sure. But we kinda went to slow last time and it was like late-ish and it was rainy. So we didn't really get to see everything. But now it's like, it's still cold but it's nicer weather. And it's like 3pm. Trying to get suffocated between that. About 3.30pm. So yeah, we'll be there by like 4. And so we'll have a lot of time to explore. Where is that yoga mat? So yeah, I'm excited for that. Um, yeah. Been chilling now. Very full. I might take a quick power nap before we go. We'll see.
