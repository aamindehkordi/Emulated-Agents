 I don't know but I think I... I look very homeless now. I don't remember doing this in the fucking beach. I don't know when the last time we did this was. We got in a hotel for the night. Which was way back. Dad, friender, Somewhere near Fresno. Pope. We ate KFC, A&W that night. Woke up, Ate the breakfast, breakfast was pretty good though. It was really good. Hampton we're in. Now, Now we headed down, back down to Morro Bay. Conditions here are Pretty similar to when we were last here. I guess the rain has finally stopped now though. Seems like. So that's good. We actually got a better view of the rock. We ate clam chowder at Giovanni's. Or I ate clam chowder at Giovanni's. Bowl, I think I liked the soup more Than Bodini's but the bowl Was a little too sour for me. Um, So I decided to feed it to the seagulls. Uh, From here we're Heading to San Luis Obispo again. About 15 minutes away I think. We'll see what we do there.
