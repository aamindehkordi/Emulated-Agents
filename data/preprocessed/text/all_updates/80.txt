 You can go now. So started off the day in Merced. Now we're in Morro Bay, going to San Luis Obispo and then home. But in Merced, that was kind of crazy because the hotel, or Santa, I thought was a pretty good area. It turns out like the parking lot was a fucking war zone for homeless people because they just went up to this fucking truck, smashed the windows and took what was inside. El Bozo, at least that truck's not my car. So yeah, that was that. And then we drove all the way down here. I didn't use directions, which I'm honestly surprised with myself that we got here without maps. But I guess that just further supports the notion that I'm the best there ever was. So yeah.
