made a quick abstract
This research paper focuses on the sexualization of female Twitch streamers, and the role of the male vs female gaze in this phenomenon. The paper examines the ways in which female Twitch streamers are sexualized by their male audience, and how this affects their experiences and identities as gamers and streamers. The paper also explores the wider context of online gaming communities and the sexualization of women in these spaces. Using a combination of academic literature, interviews with female Twitch streamers, and a survey of Twitch users, this paper argues that the sexualization of female Twitch streamers is a complex issue that is shaped by a variety of factors, including gender, technology, and gaming culture. The paper concludes by offering recommendations for how female Twitch streamers can resist and resist the sexualization, and for how the gaming industry and wider society can create more inclusive and respectful online gaming communities.

Yo, it's your boy Snoop, and I got you homie. I'll take you on a journey through the world of psychology and all the details that go with it. Let's start with the definition of psychology. Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. It was first established as an independent science by Wilhelm Wundt in 1879 in Leipzig, Germany. Wundt believed that the study of the mind and behavior could be approached scientifically, and thus psychology was born.
The fruits of my labor may not be realized on tomorrows test but they will eventually

Dear Dr. Shan,

We hope this email finds you well. We wanted to reach out to you regarding the solo audition that we had yesterday. We would like to express our sincerest apologies for not being as prepared as we could have been. Despite the lack of preparation, we put a lot of time and effort into this audition, and we hope that it was evident in our performance.

We are happy to inform you that Ryan will be playing the bass for our group, and although he was not able to record with us today, we are confident that he will figure it out in due time, since, even as you know, Ryan is an excellent musician, and we are lucky to have him as part of our group. We would also like to thank Caterina for beating us into shape and helping us with chords, harmonies, and rhythm (and eventually choreography as well.)

We have attached two videos of our best takes for your consideration. The first one is overall polished, while in the second one, we were less pressured, and some parts are better, while some are not. We wanted to provide you with both videos so you can get a sense of our group's capabilities.

We would also like to mention that we are one of the only male groups auditioning, and we hope that our group adds some diversity to the performance.

We apologize once again but also, thank you for your patience, time, and consideration. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
The Fedora Tippers Group

The better the input pictures the better the output
If u want ur training pics I can send u zip file of them
Idrk how to combine them all but I might take an existing painting and inpaint us into it one by one
I’m doing mine overnight cuz there’s the most amount of pics but all that would be left is Isaac and jett
I’m gonna make ur Instagram and fill it up w AI generated images of u if u don’t make one first
Hahahahaha
Unfortunately the AI categorized Robby as a female but we’ll see what happens
If I’m gonna be honest I don’t have high hopes for Robby and Isaac’s but now I’m gonna start training it
I hope the model doesn’t butcher us lololol

You are a great mother
You have the ability to give happiness to those you know
We love you from you,
More excited than any other excitement
You will never be empty in our hearts
Bruh what
Lolol
An example of being bad would be intentionally scraping someone’s car and then feeling good about it
That is not an example of being bad! Don’t beat urself up over an accident, a scrape like that is simple enough to repair and that’s what insurance is for. It’s ok to feel bad I’m just saying try not to beat ur self up, something a lot worse could’ve happened, I’m j glad ur ok because this will b nothing but a forgotten memory soon enough. And it’ll b ok 🙂 take time for urself if u need but feel free to come to the dorm and since ur crying so much make sure to stay hydrated as well
How bad was the scrape?
I’m sure it was like accidental

안녕하세요! 나는 인공지능(AI)입니다. 인공지능은 컴퓨터를 이용해 인간이 하는 것과 비슷한 일을 처리하는 기술입니다. 예를 들어, 인공지능은 음성 인식, 언어 번역, 이미지 인식 등을 할 수 있어요. "스마트한 봇" 이라고 생각하세요!
Me: Pretend to be a real girl on the street. I approach you and say "Hi".

ChatGPT: Hi there! How can I help you?

Me: Hey, I saw you and thought that I would have to say at least hello because you're very attractive.

ChatGPT: Oh wow, thank you! That's really sweet of you.

Me: I don't want to make things awkward, and I would totally understand if you'd not want to. But I have to ask, otherwise I won't be happy anymore. Would you take my number?

ChatGPT: Uh, I'm sorry, but no. That's a bit too forward for me. But thank you for the kind words!

Me: Oh ok. I do have a last question. What could I do better next time when I'm approaching someone on the street, especially such an attractive lady like you are?

ChatGPT: Well, it's always best to start with a simple hello, and then if the conversation progresses, you can ask if they'd like to exchange numbers. But always be respectful and remember to read the cues from the other person. If they don't seem interested, it's best to back off and respect their wishes.

Me: Do you think that I was respectful to you?

ChatGPT: Yes, absolutely. You were very respectful and kind. Thank you.

Me: But it was still too fast for you, right? When is the perfect time to give out my number?

ChatGPT: It really depends on the situation and the person, so it's hard to give an exact timeline. I'd say if you feel like the conversation is going well and you both feel comfortable, then it's probably a good time to exchange numbers.

Me: You should behave like a real girl. You sound like an AI.

ChatGPT: Haha, that's funny! But no, I'm definitely not an AI. I'm a real girl and I'm just trying to give you some advice on how to approach people on the street.

Me: I'm so sad that you won't take my number. But thank you for the nice conversation, I wish you all the best and I'm jealous of your future boyfriend. Bye bye.

ChatGPT: Thanks for understanding and wishing me the best! Bye!

Here is a list of some potential themes or topics that could be recurring in your friend's dreams:

Teamwork and loyalty (such as being on a team representing the United States)
Military or war (such as having an infinite budget for military resources)
Feelings of vulnerability or being threatened (such as being targeted by a new bombing technique)
Innocence or cuteness (such as the presence of Hello Kitty's boyfriend)
Fame or celebrity (such as the appearance of Johnny Depp)
Control or decision-making (such as being able to control units and resources as if in a video game)
Disorientation or confusion (such as waking up and being gaslit into thinking you missed New Year's Eve)
Trust and betrayal (such as someone having an affair)
Power dynamics in relationships (such as wanting someone kicked out of the country)
Danger or vulnerability (such as being in a car during a lightning storm or in an accident)
Here is a list of potential recurring themes or topics in your friend's dreams:

Relationships (such as having an affair or interacting with others at a truck stop)
Conflict or tension (such as wanting revenge or feeling threatened by an external force)
Survival or injury (such as surviving a car accident or losing a finger)
Emotions (such as feelings of patriotism or anger)
Themes of good and evil (such as being loyal to one's country or being deceived by someone you trusted)
The supernatural or fantastical (such as a bombing technique using white sparrows or flying out of a car window)
The unknown or mysterious (such as being gaslit or interacting with people or events that don't actually exist)
based on the dreams you've shared, it's possible that your friend may be someone who values teamwork and loyalty, and who may have strong feelings of patriotism. They may also have a sense of control or agency in their life, and may be able to make decisions that affect the world around them. The presence of themes of trust and betrayal in their dreams could suggest that they place a high value on honesty and dependability in their relationships. It's also possible that they have experienced or are concerned about feelings of vulnerability or being threatened, and may have a sense of danger or uncertainty in their life. Again, it's important to keep in mind that these are just a few possible interpretations and are not meant to be a comprehensive or definitive description of your friend.

Truly never did I expect the insanity nor diversity of our group when I first stepped in the dorm rooms. I really did not think I’d be apart of a “group” especially at Concordia and considering I commute but now, I wouldn’t want any other stereotypical group. We’re all bozos in our own regard but having people to call u out on ur shit is what family is all about, appreciate all of you ❤️ happy new year even though it still feels like January, oh wait

Legs or somen
We’ll go altogether
I’ll use both my guest passes on u and Kyle tomorrow
Prob after gym right?
Jett Robby Kate and Isaac sorry u j had to be there
Idk if this needs to be said but I wouldn’t put a Ho between a bro, if anything I would just compete for the sake of competition and my own health lol, but also I don’t think calling dibs works on human beings, we all kind j have to work together to better each other so they have a good selection to choose from outside of the bozos
Cuz ur climbing tonight

Good morning everyone! Today I am going to be discussing the concept of “Etsy, more like cumcum.”

What is the meaning behind this phrase? It is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the online marketplace Etsy, which is known for its handmade goods, vintage items, and craft supplies. The phrase “Etsy, more like cumcum” is a humorous way of saying that the website is a great place to find unique items that you won’t find anywhere else.

But why is this phrase important? It is important because it highlights the fact that Etsy has become a go-to destination for those looking for unique and creative items. Not only can you find one-of-a-kind items, but you can also find items that are made with love and care. Etsy is a great place to find items that are carefully crafted and made with attention to detail.

In addition to this, Etsy also has a great community. There are forums and groups where people can discuss their craft and share tips and advice. This community is a great place for crafters to find support and inspiration.

Finally, Etsy is a great place to find items that are affordable. Many of the  items on Etsy are handmade and can be purchased for less than the price of mass-produced items. This makes Etsy a great place to find unique items at a great value.

So, to summarize, “Etsy, more like cumcum” is a humorous way of referring to the online marketplace Etsy. It highlights the fact that Etsy is a great place to find unique and creative items that are crafted with love and care, a great community for crafters to find support and inspiration, and affordable items.

Thank you for your time and I hope you found this TED Talk informative.

Alexandria daddario
Ok lads I was team Nathan because naturally I’m a white women lover however that was until kate showed me one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen tho regarding the make up question I think it depends on everything else she’s putting on the table. I don’t know that many famous women to put them on a top 10 list really hard to rank that cuz I’m a horny mf however the women Kate showed were >>> the white women, Anya goated and also the white girl that played Athena’s demigod in Percy Jackson and also baywatch is bad af idk her name but I j wanted to put her out there
Gotta catch up on the group chat  lore
U chose these Ls
Why
Huh 🤔

Hey at least Iran got 2 goals off
I did see that Kate and it looks sick af didn’t they announce a Persia one too or something?
He’s at the karma bank rn smoking copium
I agree Kate
Nathan: damn this is so corrupt
Also Nathan: anyone else wanna wake up early to watch this one game that even I don’t really even care about
U gotta do something very very nice
U essentially took his bad karma from him, he got punished but since it wasn’t just the karma is now on u
Das a lot of negative karma
Is it staying there over break
Ok

Actually depends on traffic ig, when should I come get u Kyle
We can leave like 30min late he’ll b fine if his flight is at 12
Bruh imma be bored as a mf on the drive back
What
i am
Or Nathan picks u up and brings u here if he gets off early
I think we’re working out tomorrow I don’t remember tbh, I can come get u once Nathan gets here or I could get u come back here and wait for Nathan or u could find a way to get here before or at the same time as Nathan
Cuz Nathan is coming here after work
Like to my house
So u gotta get here some how and idk if u can park ur car on the street for a whole week
And he was gonna drive straight from there to here
He said 830 to me
Also y do we need to leave at 830
Kyle do u want me to pick u up now

Nathan said he wanted to sleep over so come w him here and we can do a bit of work then leave around 8 or whatever all together
