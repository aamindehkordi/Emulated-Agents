Smelled like cigarettes and shit
Def strung on something
On campus

Actually a fun topic
On the sexualization of female twitch streamers/gamers, basically focusing on the male vs female gaze/audience when it comes to sexualizing/fantasizing about people on a digital platform. Like how female streamers that are hot get hella tips for being hot despite the platform technically being a place to showcase gamers for their gameplays n stuff
Topic is real interesting I think I can do it well
I said yes
Yupppp
this is good for me lol
I’m so broke rn

Sad lunch
Goodbye
So I’m gonna go back to sleep now and try to dream again
And none of it happened
Went to discord
Thought I already texted u guys
Then I actually woke up
I closed discord and went to sleep
He told me a final grade got out and I distinctly remember him saying “don’t be mad but I got a 7/50 on my final exam”
I tried to start typing and Robby somehow knew I went to discord
You guys were playing like a over skype videocall game of battleships and it was getting really intense
It was like a huge group Skype with all of you guys
So I went to discord and all the boys were on a video call
I got up from my sleep in my dream and thought I wanted to text u guys
I fell back asleep immediatley but in my dream I was sleeping
That is what woke me up
It was crazy and I remember i#being in a tree at some point and falling
At one point a giant gorilla came out and then got eaten by a giant python then a black poisonous giant spider ate it
It was crowded like a mosh pit and everyone was fighting very realistically and from my scenario it was like I was watching it all go down from like a movie viewing perspective except it turned out they were actually filming a movie
So I was in a setting between two large tow like buildings and there were big monsters and I was with the straw hat crew except I only remember sanji and he was like a real human man
Joining dream share cuz I just woke up from a wild dream
They dive in hoards it’s so fun
No air tanks
Like just the masks
Built dif
Do u know that the halmeonis (grandmas) there literally dive for fish in groups without any scuba gear

How about will
He has to
WHAT
I looked
No it doesn’t
i didn’t 😡
yes robby
🤔🤔🤔
🤨
Absolutley not 💀
what
Jk this out of the table
<@246124303643312138> <@429701532309520404> <@443274224505716741> <@573586960938172466> <@657834634205200395> <@853858084866621480>
3. Do our own thing for today
2. Hang at Jett’s and just chill
1. Stick to OG plan and watch movie
Vote on one
Oki
Should we save the movie for another day then ?
Nooooooooo
😭😭😭😭
I’m just doing my womanly duty of being the anal one with plans 😂😂😂
the goombas got all the ideas
But usually they plan everything
HAHAHHA aw das so nice
<@573586960938172466> <@657834634205200395> <@246124303643312138> <@853858084866621480> maybe meet at Costco around 2:30? 3?
Oki no problem
Im being a mom and calculating this
So it’s a good deal
Tickets are $15.50 per if we just buy them rn 

But at Costco it’s a bundle of 2 tickets and a $10 snack gift card for $30
but we can also just all go together too
Since <@443274224505716741> and <@429701532309520404> have choir
But also it’s all good if not
If u guys work out earlier, u Nathan <@246124303643312138> and <@853858084866621480> can go to Costco earlier with me so we have more time to just chill at Jett’s house without such a time crunch
Alright let’s see what time he wants to do that
<@246124303643312138> <@429701532309520404> <@573586960938172466> <@853858084866621480> <@657834634205200395> anyone else wanna go Costco?
that’s the game plan
4:30-Jett and Kate go Costco to get regal tickets at a better price (y’all Venmo us or smthn) (potential Nathan or whoever come to grab food we can meal prep)
5-7pm-Jett house dinner and cook or hang or don’t come and just do ur own things 
7:20pm- meet at Regal theatre at (26602 Towne Centre Dr, Foothill Ranch, CA 92610)
7:25pm-movie time
9:25pm-movie done, go canes or chickfila or smthn if still hungry or go home
So
Robby fam dinner @5pm
Jett and kinjo choir till 3:30
So
Gameplan
Oki
Can someone add Ali to this chat
<@246124303643312138> 7:25pm show oki with u?
I’m just depressed
