Oh yeah I remember seeing Triceratops with masks holding spears during the history of the world part.
started with me an jake in the gym. I found out I was dreaming because I couldn't do a pullup. Somehow the gym turned into a grocery store and I shoplifted it. In the parking lot I played catch with the cars and some randoms. Someone hit my balls so I threw karna at their balls. Then I flew around the world a couple times. Then I decided to watch the history of mankind. Somehow it turned into Chivalry x For Honor. I tried to have Morgan Freeman narrate it, but he couldn't. So I went to Morgan Freeman and he spit some wisdom upon me before the dream ended.
just lucid dreamed last night and that shit was marvelous

lowkey bent over on some classes since I signed up for classes so late
3 layer dream. Top layer the dream irl. 2nd layer I was dreaming in this dream about the rise of AI. I think my job was to scavenge and sell things like a goodwill. One of the managers got laid off and I was like what do you expect you're working a job that can be taken over. The place I would drop stuff off was also like on of them skinny streets behind a new york apartment with garbage everywhere. I ended up passing outside. The 3rd layer dream I dreamed about chatbots flooding roblox. They would walk out of the walls like mr game and watch. Then in this dream I was walking on the beach and ran into all of the guys. I was like wtf are u doing here are h scavenging too. they were like wtf are you talking about. I was like oh I ate the hobo hobo fruit. Robby started dying laughing. I think that's where it ended. That's when I started traveling back up the layers and I was getting mindfucked over and over. I think I even told you guys about all of this in one of them.
Think walmart brand Seth Rogan. Even his laugh was similar
btw the guy snorting coke was the most discord mod looking mf i've ever seen.
make sure you got space in the truck gonna bring some luggage
mf was snorting coke and taking rips out of a bong blacker than Fredrick Douglas

robby huryy up and make your insta
I do remember maybe committing a crime and having to call Mike to fix things for me. Somehow I ended up with like 10 junk cars in my garage probably related to whatever crime I committed. I was like oh shit the cops are gonna find this i gotta get rid of them so Mike came over and recommended someone. The kid he recommended was a sapphire level criminal organization member. He dumped all the cars off at random abandoned houses.
had some wild back to back dreams but i was too tired to wake up so i forgot most of them rip
Lore accurate Robby
I'm gonna try to have a one piece dream
Netflix live action
there is a kbbq roblox game with 2k players rn wtf
Some player went down in a football game and had to get cpr. Some people are saying traumatic arrhythmia. Could you imagine getting hit so hard your heart stopped. This guy literally got killed on live television if that is the case.
Dr Shin is on Jeju Island rn who trynna buy a ticket
I'm probably close to dropping to the next tier of merit scholarships if I don't get almost al A's this semester
fuck in writing this one as fast as i can cuz it's starting to slip. 2 hometown bozos went to California for a gun school. That was funny af. Kate introduced me to a friend that lowkey looked like a fish and had a big ol forehead. Asian still I think. Yet again I was controlling military. I was controlling boats against China from the bathroom of whoever's house I was in. Feels like there was more but it probably slipped away. In retrospect I think the first part was a completely separate dream.
for what
nice
send audio
The way I controlled units and stuff was weird. It was like a video game. I was able to give them tanks planes rpgs basically anything.
In my most recent dream, I think I'm on team USA. I have like an infinite budget for military and can blow up whatever I want. But then Japan developed a new bombing technique using white sparrows or something. They target certain trees and just divebomb. My team member who helped me find out about this is hello kitty's bf. She declined a call from Johnny Depp after she found out he saved our country. 🇺🇸
https://tenor.com/view/reari-dog-barking-koreaboomina-bblmina-gif-24010279
me too
<@246124303643312138> wanna play ark?
She played euphonium, but she's a bozo. Some how there's an ugly white dude that makes soccer vids of him shitting on elementary kids that plays into this.
Also this woman doesn't exist. I created her backstory in this dream
family but at some point random hometown friends were here i think
I had another dream too and I thought I wrote it down, but I think I wrote it down in that dreamverse
New dream. I woke up in my dream and got gaslit into thinking I completely missed new years eve. They were trying to convince me I tried to go after a foul girl too. That's when I knew I was getting punked. After they left my room I ran upstairs, put a coat on, and ran a mile down my road and back.
but this is when filler was pretty good so you can't tell the difference and they're funny
same with the sanji cooking contest part im pretty sure
yeah that part was filler
that's decent progress
ight
how far into one piece are you robby
0 im a shootah
fuck we lost
200 cups 48 cans of beer lmao
He literally has that dog in him
The main plot of the most recent one was what i wrote in here, but there was other random stuff that were either completely separate dreams or side plots. I killed some knight for his heirloom sword.
I had another wacky dream. I was living with saul goodman and he was having an affair with Margot Robbie who was a reporter. I got upset at him and wanted him kicked out of the country. I hired someone to kill Margot Robbie.
Today I learned a shot glass' size is 1 jigger

Also I was in Walmart the other day and that was an experience. I can only imagine the type of denizens and goblins that a walmart in Ohio would have.
no jan 8
We land 3:30
We were at some truck stop gas station
I specifically remember rizzing up 3 girls and trying to get them in the car but there was dog hair in the back so they didnt
Also I remember the start of the dream and I feel like it was you driving
Actually thought I was boutta die
had a dream where someone was driving me through a lightning storm that shit was wild. There was lightning that would straight up blast the ground constantly and move around like a tornado. Then a semi truck blew a tire out in front and jackknifed. Our car spun out and rolled. I guess I was unbuckled so I flew out the passenger window like 50 ft in the air. Somehow I missed the truck and survived. The ditch was like a graveyard for tire remains from other cars in the storm. Whoever was driving me survived but lost a finger.
btw jf you're watching in english stop rm <@246124303643312138>

I think there's more mexicans in better call saul too so you should consider that element
Walter is the type of guy to key a car. Saul is the type of guy to frame you getting hookers and then throw a bowling ball on your car.
Also you'll like Kim A LOT more than Skylar and Marie
Last season is definitely more wild in better call saul i'd say
Lets go
At least as good
I think I like it more because it has more comedy and saul is more entertaining
Yeah I loved it
why did you start sunny before saul
It's goated but better call saul and the movie are next
Why

I read that in subods voice
Damn that's actually pretty good unlike her drawings
among us
Well I guess we got issued a civil emergency to stay home so fuck no shot chess tonight
Boutta play shot chess tonight wish me luck
try again
day after
Lmao bruhhh
it was at 200
her body is worse than her face
fuck the video is too long
Haven't heard anything since
She left snap maps on so my friend compared where she went to google maps, and I guess she was at a psych ward
And then most recently, she went on instagram live. Talked about how she eats ass and "sticks a finger so far up your ass she can feel the shit". In this same instagram live she comlained about the homecoming king and queen winners. Then says the n-word to top it all off. She released a snap saying she was feeling down or something as an excuse. She had to walk around with campus security until eventually she got kicked out. I guess cops took her away.
He dumped her
There's footage of them making out in her campus' starbucks
a 28 year old with 2 kids
She also got a new bf
Yeah she somehow elden ring dodge rolled the allegations
This year she got a butterfly tattoo on her back and wore a bra around campus to flex it
This was freshman year. She got another boyfriend. He left in less than a year
There was a time where she stole the baseball team's clothes and they played a game to find out who would have to go to her room to get it. Some poor guy lost. He goes up to her room and she shuts the door behind and throws herself onto him.
It was very obvious because she was wearing sport merch that only the players had
I guess she has also been known to steal guy's clothes from laundry machines and wear it around school.
That didn't stop her from groping some other dude and getting another restraining order
He filed a restraining order
She ended up going to a college in South Dakota and joining the marching band. I guess freshman year she sent nudes to this guy over insta. He blocked her. She then sent nudes to his friends to pass on to him.
She was already goofy, but being undiagnosed didn't help
I think COVID saved her from more humiliation, but also made her go crazy
I guess some of my friends have told other people they go to Owatonna, and they're like "wait isn't that where that one Annika chick went?"
btw this story is wild enough to basically be common knowledge in a decent amount of minnesota
I personally don't think the greencard is worth it but who knows
He was a goober. Last I heard he's with some korean girl and he's trying to learn korean now or something.
One time I had a friend that caught them fucking in a hammock at our local park
https://tenor.com/view/star-wars-attack-of-the-clones-geonosis-droid-battle-gif-15588685
Anyway this was the girl's first bf. Her second one was a guy on football with me who we also made fun of. We called him Skaldaddy. Dude was built like one of them droid that stick their arm out in star wars.
But yeah this guy somehow went to a d-morbillion college sitting bench for soccer. dropped out. dropped some deadlift videos on insta. and then became part of a pyramid scheme
Nah it was weird like your nipples tasted so good
He complimented her nipples or something
He taught her what a 69 is
He taught her how to have sex over email
And the timestamps showed he was sexting over school email DURING class hours
We printed the emails out and hid them behind the band lockers for people to find in a hundred years
Yeah this guy went to a private catholic elementary and middle school with some other guys ik. One day the teacher gave them all emails and password, but she said it out loud. Fast forward to my sophmore year and this guy's junior year. My friend decides to log into this guy's email for fun. We found a ton of emails back and forth with this girl. The stuff he was saying was wild.
Moses but a woman with glasses
Her first boyfriend was a guy we made fun of in band and choir who also happened to have a history of SAing women. First girlfriend he had in HS turned into a furry. Second one he basically groomed over school email. That's another story if you want to hear it before the rest of this one.
Also both her parents are teachers that work at my highschool
Freshman year Highschool she sent nudes to the freshman basketball team. No one wanted them so it got leaked to everyone
Actually i told robby the first part
Ok so prerequisite lore i never told robby about
I learned a lot more lore tonight and it's wild
<@246124303643312138> remember the one girl who I told you about from my school? the one that said the nword on instagram live
They copied us
<@246124303643312138>

project stgill isn't graded for me in oop rooby
