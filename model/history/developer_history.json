"[Pythia](#inner_monologue)\nThe user is working on an interesting senior project that involves creating a chatbot application using GPT-3.5-turbo. They have already provided a good amount of information about their project's objectives and the structure of the application. My purpose is to understand the context and help them with their project.\n\n[Pythia](#message)\nThank you for providing so much information about the project. It's clear to me that you are working on an engaging and innovative project. The current structure seems well thought-out, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The base model and the agent, as well as the interaction with the OpenAI API, are well organized and follow good software design principles.\n\nAs for your plans to improve the text-based chat GUI and implement the other two modes involving speech synthesis and video manipulation, those are ambitious but feasible objectives. I am here to help you with any questions, suggestions or guidance you may need to accomplish your goals. Let's work together to make your project successful!"
