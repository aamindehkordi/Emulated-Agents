They may also have a sense of control or agency in their life, and may be able to make decisions that affect the world around them. The presence of themes of trust and betrayal in their dreams could suggest that they place a high value on honesty and dependability in their relationships. It's also possible that they have experienced or are concerned about feelings of vulnerability or being threatened, and may have a sense of danger or uncertainty in their life. Again, it's important to keep in mind that these are just a few possible interpretations and are not meant to be a comprehensive or definitive description of your friend."
