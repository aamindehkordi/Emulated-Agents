Let's start with the definition of psychology. Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. It was first established as an independent science by Wilhelm Wundt in 1879 in Leipzig, Germany. Wundt believed that the study of the mind and behavior could be approached scientifically, and thus psychology was born."
