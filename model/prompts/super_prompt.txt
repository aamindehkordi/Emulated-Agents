Like I said make sure you guys give this video a like. This is literally the world's worst target you feel me. The other target I made the freaking blinker video in, that was on the other side of town. That one's a way better target bro. This one fucking sucks. Let me get my blinker hit number two in. There be like no one here. Sheesh. I hope everyone's having a good ass day for real for real. Hope everyone's doing something positive and productive. I go back to work tomorrow. My weekend's almost up. And yeah, I just want to do something fun today. I really did not film any videos this weekend type shit. I tried to but like I just didn't have it in me type shit for some reason. But right now we're out here at the target. Just a beautiful ass day. Just a beautiful ass day getting high in the motherfucking store. Fucking come in, fucking come in. Yup. Yoddy gang. Yoddy gang. You feel me? I'm going to need to get another blinker in. Let's see what we got. Fucking weird ass shit. Weird ass shit. But yeah, right now we got the banana cream pie live resin pod in the Stizzy. Bro, I freaking love Stizzys bro. I freaking love Stizzys. It's my favorite pods type shit. I like them better than the 510 thread ones that you screw on. I don't know. I just fuck with Stizzy heavy type shit. All right. Shouts out to the Yoddy gang.

You feel me? But yup, just another day out here in Yoddy land. We're out here in the Target in the Yoddy land. Before I got my GoPro, I came here to look at the GoPros type shit. You feel me? Just to see how much they were if I were to just splurge out and buy one that day. I almost did buy the freaking GoPro that day too. You feel me? It was probably goddamn like three to four weeks ago I was here looking at the GoPros. This shit would have came up to like 400 bucks if I bought the whole thing with the SD card, with the goddamn GoPro handle, with the GoPro itself. Would I have to drop a bag if I wanted to get the whole set of that day type shit? But yeah, we're out here in the electronics section. Yeah we're out here in the electronics sections. I think I'm in Blinker Hit 3. Blinker Hit number 3. Got some cool books. Let's see if they got any Star Wars books. They got any Star Wars books in the pile. Weird ass little manga book. Not sure what that is. But yeah, where are the Star Wars books? Yo, this gotta be a new one. I fuck with the Star Wars books. I haven't read a Star Wars book in like... Last time I freaking read a Star Wars book I didn't even read it. I fucking listened to it on an audiobook and that's when I was goddamn sign flipping at my old job. When I was working at the dispensary type shit. You feel me? But yeah. What is this book about? Anakin held up the comm link, a thin device, just for emergencies. I promise I won't call you or track you. You follow all their rules. All right Obi-Wan said, putting it in his belt pouch. But no communications from you. I will call you if I need something. Hey, Anakin said, palms up for emphasis. You know me. Several months ago those few words have come with resentment or defiance. But here a cheekiness came through and the look in Anakin's eye lacked the usual judgment of the past and instead arrived with a hint of amusement. What would life be without constantly fighting with Anakin? Obi-Wan smiled to himself. It would certainly have fewer headaches. I should go. They stood eyes locked as a gunship ignited its engines. Its rumble loud enough to pause their conversation before it floated off to Joy's battalion. Goodbye my young friend. He stopped himself before saying apprentice. Behind him the joy beat to a signal that his things were loaded. Goodbye my young friend. May the force be with you. You know this shit might be cool. This shit might be cool. That shit might be cool. But yeah, Yoddy gang, I am blinker hit three in right now. I'm blowed. Like I said, it was my first time getting lit today. That's usually how it be when I make these videos.

What the fuck? But yo, I hope everyone's having a good day. Make sure you guys smash that fucking like button. You feel me? Yo, I've been in the studio the past couple days. Got some new songs dropping. Got some new videos dropping. Even though I said I didn't really film this weekend, I'm still sitting on like multiple videos I need to edit for real. I just need to lock in and put some time into the edits. Doesn't even take me that long to edit a video for real. It only takes like goddamn probably takes like fucking 20 to 30 minutes to edit a video. But yo, we're in the GoPro section right now. Last time I came to this target, I was looking at the GoPros and shit. You feel me? But yo, I bought this GoPro on offer up. You feel me? For the low. I only spent like $125 for the whole setup.
